What is Programming language

-  It is language which helps to communicate with computers {they are not able to understand human languages} We humans have lots of 
   languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)Computers have many languages too Assembly, C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go…. Prog lang. Helps us to write programs using those languages.
  
#### What is Program?

-  A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming language. An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician, Al-Khwarizmi.
- [ ] an algorithm must finite action.

##### Evolution of I/O { Input / Output }
1. Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on punch cards and Output was to a line printer.
2. Later developments introduced interactive processing which allowed the user to provide data while the program was running.
##### Generation of Computers
1. First Generation: Vacuum Tubes => punch cards
2. Second Generation: Transistors => Programming started here with Assembly (transistor:-Small electronic Device that changed the world.)
3. Third Generation: Integrated Circuits => BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl and Ada
4. Fourth Generation: Microprocessors => Python, SQL,Matlab
5. Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence

### Types of Programming Languages
-  Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans 
don’t understand this SO based on the closeness of the language to humans we classify it into 3  The more they become low to the machine they are faster, and high will be vise verses.
1. Low level pl: machine like language.
2. High level pl: human like language.
3. Medium level pl: inbetween human and machine language.

#### How do high level languages work?
- As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binaries, and if we code with high level languages
how do computers understand us?

1)Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then computer will execute it.
 Example: C,C++,Java,..
2)Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line
Example: python
###### Uses of Programming language
- Android Application Development
- Website Development
- Machine learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Game Development
- Big data Technology
- Desktop software development
- Hacking tool development
#### What is Python Programming?
- Python is a High level & interpreted programming 
  language. Easy to use too.
  There are two version of python
  1. Version 2
  2. Version 3
we will see more about version 3 in this course
*Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.*
##### Uses of Python

1. Data visualization
2. Data analysis
3. Machine learning
4. Artificial intelligence
5. Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
6. Game development
7. Hacking Script writing
Note: code is something we write inorder to communicate

1. **IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a 
     Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming language. Example: PythonIDE**

 2. Code Editors: are softwares those can help to write any kind of programming languages. And also by adding some compiling/ interpreting feature they can run programs/scripts Example: Sublime,Vscode

 ###### Outputs and comments
 
 print: is a key word used to display the output.
*syntax*: print ( object, separate, end)
          Print ('object ', sep='  ', end='  ')
        \n : new line
        \t: tab space have 
comments:use #
- comment wont be executed.
- comments are simply what we write inorder to remember.
There are so many different key words on python
*break, def, import...*
