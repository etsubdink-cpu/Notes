 #### what is network?
 
 A network consists of two or more entities or objects 
sharing resources and information.
- a computer network must have a minimum 2 connected device.
- Computers on a network can act as *a client* or *a server.*
1. Client computer: A client is a computer that requests for resources.
2. Server computer: A server is a computer that controls and provides access to resources. But have higher RAM,CPU and STORAGE.

Classification of Networks
1. Classification by network geography:Networks are frequently classified according to the geographical boundaries spanned by the network itself.LAN, WAN, and MAN are the basic types of classification, of which LAN and WAN are frequently used.

2. Classification by component roles:Networks can also be classified according to the roles that the networked computers play in the network’s operation.Peer-to-peer, server-based, and client-based are the types of roles into which networks are classified.
      1. Peer-to-peer
- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal.Each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as either a client or a server depending upon the requirement.
- Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
  They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
- Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking 
  capability.
- The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer 
  network is ten.
    2. Server based
- A server-based network offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations.
 - A dedicated server is one that services the network by storing data, applications, resources, and also provides access to resources required by the client.
    3. Client-based
-  Client-based network servers process requests from 
clients and return just the results.
- These networks take advantage of the powerful 
processing capabilities of both the client and the 
server.
#### IP /Internet Protocol/ address 

 IP (Internet Protocol) is a Network Layer Protocol.A way to identify machines on a network(A unique identifier)
 
##### some of its advantages:-
-  Used to connect to another computer or network.
-  Allows transfers of files and e-mail
-  Identify a device
#### IP types
 Based On IP versions
1. IPv4( Internet protocol version 4)
    - An IPv4 address is a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s.To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods This way of writing the address is called the dotted decimal format. IP generated by DHCP or Manually.
    #### Private and Public IP addresses.
- Any HOST have 2 different IP’s
1. Public IP: is an ip address that is given to the host on the WAN network.
2. Private IP:is ip that is given to the host on LAN network.
1. IPv6( Internet protocol version 6)
    - 128 bit, alphanumeric (hexa decimal)
    - 1-10 including letters or alphabet
