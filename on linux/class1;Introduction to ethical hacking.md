 **step 4.** create repository on GitHub 
 **step 5**. add the repo link
 **step 6.** generate token (BTW this is one time only ) 
 **step 7.** push it to GitHub
2. by using VS code
3. by uploading the extracting file
4. . by using GitHub desktop
   - GitHub desktop is a free application that helps code host on GitHub or Git
- step 1: create a new repository
